            <h1>BAT<span>MAN</span></h1>
            <p>After witnessing the murder of his parents during a mugging in Gotham City, young Bruce Wayne embarks on a lifelong quest for justice and vengeance.
            <br> <br>
            <span>Years of training and self-discipline shape him into the formidable vigilante known as Batman, who uses his wealth, intelligence, and physical prowess to protect the innocent and strike fear into the hearts of criminals, aiming to prevent others from experiencing the same tragedy he endured as a child.</span></p>

            <h1><span>JO</span>KER</h1>
            <p><span>The Joker's origin is shrouded in mystery, but one prevailing version depicts him as the criminal alias of failed comedian Arthur Fleck.</span>
                <br> <br>
                Living in Gotham City, Fleck descends into madness due to a series of tragic events, including a failed stand-up comedy career, losing his job, and facing a broken society. 
                <br> <br>
                <span>Driven to the edge, he eventually dons the twisted clown persona of the Joker, a chaotic force of anarchy and insanity. With a sadistic sense of humor and a penchant for chaos, the Joker becomes Batman's most iconic and unpredictable nemesis, forever entwined in a relentless battle of wits and wills.</span></p>
